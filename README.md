The task aimed to assist the HR department of a telecom company in analyzing data to enhance diversity and inclusion within the organization.

I took a more nuanced approach by analyzing:
•	Performance ratings by gender
•	Employee strength post-promotion
•	Average performance ratings
•	Time spent in each role before promotion
•	Attrition rates, all categorized by gender

Dynamic KPIs such as the total number of employees, attrition rates, promotion rates, and average ratings by gender were also included. 

Key insights from the new report:
•	Performance Ratings: The performance ratings for male and female employees are almost equal,
with the average rating slightly higher for males (2.42 vs. 2.41 for males). The same trend observed across different rating buckets and departments.
•	Time Spent Before Promotion: On average, females spend more time in each role than male.
For example, female directors have an average tenure of 4.25 years versus 3.5 years for male directors. 
This difference could highlight potential biases in promotion timelines.
•	Promotions: Females are underrepresented in promotions, with only 4% of females promoted compared to 9.5% of males. 
•	Employee Strength Post-Promotion: A disparity in senior positions is evident. 
•	After promotions, ~11% of directors are male, while only 2 % of promoted employees at this level are female. This shows a skew toward male representation in higher positions.
•	Attrition Rates: The attrition rate is slightly higher for females (10%) compared to males (8.8%). 
•	Additionally, performance ratings show a noticeable difference in attrition trends, 
with female employees leaving at higher performance levels compared to male employees, suggesting a need to explore the reasons behind this pattern.
